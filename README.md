Repository for Object Counter (ES) and Blood Donation Site (DBS) Projects
This repository contains two distinct projects:

Object Counter Using IR Sensor (ES Project): A real-time object counting system that uses an infrared (IR) sensor to detect and count objects passing through a predefined area. This project demonstrates the integration of sensor hardware with software to automate the object counting process for various applications.

Blood Donation Site (DBS Project): A fully functional website designed for managing blood donation events. The site allows users to register, view donation schedules, and connect with nearby donation camps. The project focuses on building an intuitive web interface and backend to facilitate blood donation drives.
